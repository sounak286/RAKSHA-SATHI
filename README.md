Title:  “Smart Analytics Dashboard for Police Good Work Recognition”
Background:
Police districts across the state regularly conduct special drives such as those against illegal firearms, narcotics, sand mining, and missing persons, and also record data on convictions, preventive actions, and important detections through the CCTNS Good Work Portal. Currently, data entry and performance assessment are largely manual, making it difficult to visualize trends, identify top-performing districts, and recognize good work efficiently.
Problem:
Design and develop an AI-powered Smart Dashboard System that can automatically analyze, visualize, and rank district-level police performance using data from the CCTNS “Good Work Done” module. The system should support interactive analytics, trend identification, and data-driven insights for recognition and decision-making.
Key Requirements:
Automated Data Processing:
Ingest and clean data from multiple CCTNS modules (Special Drives, Convictions, Detections, etc.).
Handle diverse formats (Excel, CSV, PDF uploads, manual forms).
Visualization and Analytics:
Display district-wise and drive-wise performance (e.g., NBW execution rate, conviction ratio, drug seizure volume).
Trend analysis over time (month-wise, drive-wise).
Highlight top-performing districts or police stations.
AI/ML Insights:
Predict potential underperforming districts or areas needing attention.
Use natural language summaries (“This month, Ganjam led in narcotics enforcement with 18 arrests”).
Recognition & Reporting:
Generate auto-reports for “Good Work Done” highlighting exceptional performance.
Allow export in official formats (PDF, Excel).
Optional Add-ons:
Gamified leaderboard for police units.
Integration with GIS for location-based visualization.
Mobile-friendly interface for supervisory officers.
Expected Outcome:

A working prototype web application/dashboard that transforms raw CCTNS “Good Work” data into actionable intelligence and recognition insights, encouraging data-driven performance evaluation within the police department.
Impact:
This solution will help senior officers identify best practices, promote healthy competition, and ensure transparency and motivation in recognizing police good work across districts.
